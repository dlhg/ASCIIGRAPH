ASCII Bar Graph Renderer
This is a program that generates bar graphs using ASCII characters. The output visualizes data with a simple and aesthetic representation. The project began as a solution to a coding challenge posed by a friend, used in senior backend interviews. I enjoyed the process and may expand on this idea in the future.
